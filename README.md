# Lynda - Creating A Sortable Table

HTML tables don't have to be a static read-only affair. Learn how to create tables that allow users to sort them any way they see fit. Learn how to use jQuery and a free plugin called tablesorter to create a sortable, interactive table with just a few lines of code. You will learn how to add indicator arrows and colors with CSS and create a custom parser to sort dates more intelligently.
